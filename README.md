# Sudoku Solver using Image Recognition

This project is a Sudoku solver implemented in Python using computer vision techniques and the OpenCV library. The goal of the project is to recognize and solve Sudoku puzzles from images by applying pre-processing steps, optical character recognition (OCR), and pure computer vision operations.

## Features

- Reads Sudoku puzzles from images
- Applies pre-processing techniques to enhance image quality
- Performs optical character recognition (OCR) to extract numbers from the puzzle
- Solves the Sudoku puzzle using computer vision operations
- Supports complex test cases, including frequency domain test cases and puzzles captured in low-light environments

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ````shell
   git clone https://github.com/rafikghaly/Sudoku-Image-Solver.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ````shell
   cd sudoku-solver
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ````shell
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have a Sudoku puzzle image available.

2. The script will process the image, extract the Sudoku puzzle, solve it, and display the solution on the screen.
